# Dynoerr - Twitter for Dinosaurus

The idea comes from a video by The Coding Train and The Coding Garden on YouTube, where they show how to create a full-stack application using **NodeJS**, **Express** and **MongoDB**

Their idea was to replicate a Twitter for cats, which is fine, but I, being a geologist and all, wanted to create a Twitter for dinosaurus. They might get some benefits, you know.

The whole idea is basically to recreate the most basic Twitter functionalities such as hashtags and tags.

### TODO

- [ ] There's still no reply option;
- [ ] Infinite scrolling, 10-by-10;
- [ ] Right now everyone can just put a name and send a roar, there is no check so the same name might belong to different users;
- [ ] Rate limiting and bad word check
- [ ] Deployment
